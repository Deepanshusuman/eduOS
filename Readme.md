# 🌍 eduOS: Rebuilding Subjects for the AI World

> Education isn't broken. It's just running an outdated operating system.

This is **eduOS** — an open, modular, level-based subject framework for the AI age. It breaks down the rigid boundaries of "Class 1–12" and replaces them with progressive **levels of mastery**, fueled by curiosity, creativity, and real-world challenges.

No more subjects taught in isolation. No more memorizing for tests.  
This is education for **builders, thinkers, and dreamers** of the future.

## 🧭 Why Rebuild Subjects?

Traditional subjects are:
- Fragmented (math vs science vs art)
- Static (same books, same path for all)
- Disconnected from the real world

But the future demands:
- **Interdisciplinary thinking**
- **Real-world application**
- **AI, ethics, and creativity**
- **Learners who *choose* their path**

---

## 🧠 Core Philosophy

- 🧩 **Level-Based Learning** — Move forward based on skill, not age
- 🔗 **Connected Subjects** — Math + Design + Ethics + AI come together
- 💡 **Projects over Exams** — Learning through making, doing, failing
- 🤖 **AI Integration** — Learn *with* AI, not just about it
- 🌱 **Lifelong Learner Mindset** — Subjects designed for growth, not grades

## 🎓 Subjects Reimagined

Each subject is restructured into 5–6 levels, not classes.  
They can be learned **non-linearly** and **cross-linked** for interdisciplinary growth.

| Subject     | Focus                                                            | Format        |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| 🧠 Math      | From patterns to AI models                                       | `Math.md`      |
| 🔬 Science   | From observations to designing systems and simulating nature     | `Science.md`   |
| 💬 Language  | From storytelling to persuasive design and code literacy         | `Language.md`  |
| 🧱 Design     | From Lego to UX and systems design                              | `Design.md`    |
| ⚖️ Ethics     | From simple choices to complex global dilemmas and AI morality  | `Ethics.md`    |
| 🧪 Projects   | Real-world missions, hackathons, and build challenges            | `Projects.md`  |

Each folder contains:
- 📚 Syllabus (level-wise)
- 🔍 Core concepts & skill trees
- 🧠 AI integrations
- 🎯 Sample projects
- 🛠 Toolkits (Scratch, Python, Figma, etc.)
