# 🔬 Science Reimagined: From Curiosity to Cosmos

> "Science isn't just what we know — it's how we ask the universe questions."

**Science Reimagined** replaces rote memorization with **wonder-driven investigation**, hands-on experimentation, and system-level thinking.  
In a world shaped by AI, climate shifts, and bio-tech, this subject becomes a toolkit for **understanding complexity**, **solving real problems**, and **protecting our planet**.

## 🌟 Philosophy

- 🧪 **From Facts to Inquiry**: Asking good questions matters more than recalling answers.
- 🧬 **From Diagrams to Discovery**: Learn science by doing, simulating, and testing.
- 🧠 **From Siloed to Systems**: Biology, physics, chemistry, environment — all are one web.
- 🤖 **From Static to AI-powered**: Work with real data and AI to explore unknowns.
